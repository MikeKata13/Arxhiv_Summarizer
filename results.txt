Summary: Cloud computing offers an opportunity to run compute-resource intensive
climate models at scale by parallelising model runs such that datasets useful
to the exoplanet community can be produced efficiently. To better understand
the statistical distributions and properties of potentially habitable planetary
atmospheres we implemented a parallelised climate modelling tool to scan a
range of hypothetical atmospheres.Starting with a modern day Earth atmosphere,
we iteratively and incrementally simulated a range of atmospheres to infer the
landscape of the multi-parameter space, such as the abundances of biological
mediated gases (\ce{O2}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{H2O}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{H2}, and \ce{N2})
that would yield `steady state' planetary atmospheres on Earth-like planets
around solar-type stars. Our current datasets comprises of \numatmospheres
simulated models of exoplanet atmospheres and is available publicly on the NASA
Exoplanet Archive. Our scalable approach of analysing atmospheres could also
help interpret future observations of planetary atmospheres by providing
estimates of atmospheric gas fluxes and temperatures as a function of altitude.
Such data could enable high-throughput first-order assessment of the potential
habitability of exoplanetary surfaces and sepcan be a learning dataset for
machine learning applications in the atmospheric and exoplanet science domain.

Title: Global Warming In Ghana's Major Cities Based on Statistical Analysis of NASA's POWER Over 3-Decades
Authors: Joshua Attih
Summary: Global warming's impact on high temperatures in various parts of the world
has raised concerns. This study investigates long-term temperature trends in
four major Ghanaian cities representing distinct climatic zones. Using NASA's
Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) data, statistical analyses
assess local climate warming and its implications. Linear regression trend
analysis and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning predict
temperature variations. Land Surface Temperature (LST) profile maps generated
from the RSLab platform enhance accuracy. Results reveal local warming trends,
particularly in industrialized Accra. Demographic factors aren't significant.
XGBoost model's low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) scores demonstrate
effectiveness in capturing temperature patterns. Wa unexpectedly has the
highest mean temperature. Estimated mean temperatures for mid-2023 are: Accra
27.86{\deg}C, Kumasi 27.15{\deg}C, Kete-Krachi 29.39{\deg}C, and Wa
30.76{\deg}C. These findings improve understanding of local climate warming for
policymakers and communities, aiding climate change strategies.
